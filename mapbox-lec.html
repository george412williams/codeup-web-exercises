NOTES
-there are a number of diff services mapbox offers, we will specifically use mapbox GL JS (using JS)
-older mapbox JS, depricated
-version change to date: changing specific length and script
-curric code still jives, better to use still the mapbox documentation to copy/paste

-went to site, documentation, quick start
-copypaste those things and baby you got a map
-will be using through a CDN rather than installing as a button suggested (look into the rel btwn install and CDN)
-so get scripts in
-->



<div id='map' style='width: 400px; height: 300px;'></div>
<script>

    //mapboxgl.accessToken = 'pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2VvcmdlNDEyd2lsbGlhbXMiLCJhIjoiY2s5dmRuY3FrMGJtaTNrb2wzMWoxZ3JkayJ9.-tWzmK8_UcIad6genvKtGQ';
    //this will be deleted and replaced with file reference to file in .gitignore file
    mapboxgl.accessToken = mapboxKey;

    var map = new mapboxgl.Map({
        container: 'map',
        style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9'
    });

<!--
real work happening in this custom script
can change style here
var map creates another obj, when we create a map obj can pass another obj for beh
container: has to match with div id
style: road, topo, sat, etc chosen here
enough to a map to be created, but can do much more when first created, more to come
best practice to avoid putting token on github, others can steal bc we rely on these codes
    there are bots skimming github to things that look like tokens, api keys etc.
    REMOVE:
    previouse class: email services for your app for auto emails, req authentication tokens
        some mbrs put it out there in git, the service found it, banned them for not being responsible
        keep in mind, can keep it from showing up
    inspet the page elements, on client side, no way to prevent seeing like personal sites
        not likely to take that versus github
    so other users seeing is generally ok, github is the hot center


there is a specific var that rels to maps: mapboxgl. refers to whole mapbox tech to play with
open a console and do mapboxgl and displays as ojbect
can create a new mapbox object, in obj you find the property accessToken, autos to your public access key
can swap it out with other key
if creating a proj with it, use a unique API key for it
want to create a new API key for each proj, if stolen you can change just that API key instead of all
