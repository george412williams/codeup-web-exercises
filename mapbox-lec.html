NOTES
-there are a number of diff services mapbox offers, we will specifically use mapbox GL JS (using JS)
-older mapbox JS, depricated
-version change to date: changing specific length and script
-curric code still jives, better to use still the mapbox documentation to copy/paste

-went to site, documentation, quick start
-copypaste those things and baby you got a map
-will be using through a CDN rather than installing as a button suggested (look into the rel btwn install and CDN)
-so get scripts in
-->



<div id='map' style='width: 400px; height: 300px;'></div>
<script>
    mapboxgl.accessToken = 'pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2VvcmdlNDEyd2lsbGlhbXMiLCJhIjoiY2s5dmRuY3FrMGJtaTNrb2wzMWoxZ3JkayJ9.-tWzmK8_UcIad6genvKtGQ';
    var map = new mapboxgl.Map({
        container: 'map',
        style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9'
    });
</script>
<!--
real work happening in this custom script
can change style here
var map creates another obj, when we create a map obj can pass another obj for beh
container: has to match with div id
style: road, topo, sat, etc chosen here
enough to a map to be created, but can do much more when first created, more to come

there is a specific var that rels to maps: mapboxgl. refers to whole mapbox tech to play with
open a console and do mapboxgl and displays as ojbect
can create a new mapbox object, in obj you find the property accessToken, autos to your public access key
can swap it out with other key
if creating a proj with it, use a unique API key for it
want to create a new API key for each proj, if stolen you can change just that API key instead of all
