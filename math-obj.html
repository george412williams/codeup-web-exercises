        //make use of math object to make maths easier
        //math.random gives us by itself
        console.log(Math.random());
        // creating number btwn 0 and 1, often is never a 0 or 1
        // 0 to 100?
        console.log(Math.random() * (100));
        // floor method, rounding method that of course rounds down
        console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()) * ((100 + 1)));
        // will never get 100 here from random, highest will be one less than max
        //unless you do +1 to include it
        //math.floor is minimum is included, add the +1 to make max inclusive
        console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()) * ((100 - 50) + 50));
        //you would then add on + 50, now get rando btwn 50 and 99; use (100 - 50 + 1) for 100
        //in order to make it an inclusive maximum
        console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()) * (51) + 50);
        // the + 50 is what makes it 50 to 100 inclusively
        console.log(Math.ceil(Math.random()) * (100 - 50) + 50);
        //the reverse of floor, rounding does not happen until after the multiplication
        //won't get 0 unless you get a number other than 0 such as 0.34542345, will round up regardless
        //so Math.floor will be preferred

        console.log(Math.ceil(4.9));
        //if you want modularity:
        console.log(Math.round(4.4), 4);
        console.log(Math.round(4.5), 5);

    //EXPONENTS
        //there has been a recent JS change here
        //previously:
        //we need to be thinking about our user base, as a preview diff people use diff browsers etc
        //by running on older vers people can still use the net with this method:
        console.log(Math.pow(4,2), 16);
        //two arguments; first number to be raised, second is exponent

        // the change, E20 (Echma script 20) expects the following:
            console.log(4 ** 4);
            //expect to see with firefox, opera, maybe edge, chrome, the upToDate platforms
            //legacy hardware, want to keep in mind older computers
    //SQRT
        console.log(Math.sqrt(64)); console.log(Math.cbrt(99));
    //CONSTANTS in Math
        //Math.E, Math.PI
