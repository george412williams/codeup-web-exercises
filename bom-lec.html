        var pillow = "MyPillow";
        var arr = [1,2,3];

        //console.log(window);
        // by having these vars in a IFFI is important to sensitive info
        // cannot do:
        // console.log(window.pillow); because pillow is not in window's scope
            // consoling pillow will not produce anything in general also, console is assumed in the window global

        // alert("Hi, register for my site!:);" +
        // window.alert("You really should register for my site...");
            // so if vars are outside, var is added to window object and is public, they open console
            // and can see all global defined vars, dangerous, tools used against you...


        // window obj hanging onto global vars and using the methods

        // Writing code a set # of times that can run a certain # of times, multiple times: setMultiple

        //set up an interval

        //two arguements that go in
        // - 1: callback function (handler)  //entire purpose to handle what happens every time
        // - 2: the time. amount of time in milliseconds before the code runs again.
        // no para for fx, but has conditional logic

        // setInterval(function() {
        //     var yesNo = confirm("Do you like websites chronicling the news surrounding the murder hornets?");

        //     }
        // // want 3 seconds, so in ms...
        // }, 3000);

            // so every 3 seconds given the alert

        // How to cleawr the interval ID?
        // 1 - Set your setInterval method to a variable. This is bc the return of ur set interval method is an interval ID.
            // so:

        var intervalID = setInterval(function() {
            var yesNo = confirm("Do you like websites chronicling the news surrounding the murder hornets?");
            console.log(yesNo);

            }
            // want 3 seconds, so in ms...
        }, 3000);

        // clearInterval not like a return, will run code after it, would only not run if you added return followed by console.log that will now log
        // keep in mind 2 parameters for setInterval method
            // can also pass a named fx, would just give name without () so it takes fx def and not value and the time in ms before first interval

        function handler() {    // no argument
            var yesNo = confirm("Do you like websites chronicling the news surrounding the murder hornets?");

            console.log(intervalID);
            //depending on set number of intervals, var is set to that variable   ?
            // var murderHornetID = setInterval(handler, 3000); ...to show that you can name the IDs; console.log(murderHornetID);

        //real world ex:

            // var registerForMyWebzone = setInterval(function () {
            //     if (confirm("Hey, register for my website's mailing list?")) {
            //         // to annoyingly ask:
            //         var userEmail = prompt("What is your email?");
            //         clearInterval(registerForMyWebzone);
            //     }
            //     // to truly ask, annoy, set to 30s = 30000ms, but using 3s to see it happen
            // }, 3000)

            // banking example:...

            // setTimeout

            // similar to setInterval but only meant to happen once.

            setTimeout(function () {
                alert("CONGRATS! YOU WON!");

            // need the fx definition here
            setTimeout(alertAdBlock, 4500);

            // q on DOM events, like starting an interval when something happens, ex: when event happens start/stop, clear the interv, wait for it again, if nothing happens at this certain time frame prompt this...
            // q on like what NETFLIX does "are you still watching?"

    //====LOCATION OBJECTS====

            //similar to an HTML anchor

    //====LOCATION RELOAD====

            //like an art app with freeform draw, you want to clear the drawing, can just reload page or

            if(confirm("Did you make a boo-boo?")) {

            location.reload(true);
            //deprication: something has been marked for removal in the future but yet removed, when developing code and see it marked want to see how you can replace that
            // he's looking at why here...looks like page only allows refresh from server, not cache, going to dig here
            // his answer will be in the slack
