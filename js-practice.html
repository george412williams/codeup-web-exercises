<!--when mult scripts, read top to bottom-->
<!--can add script tag-->
    <script src="js/js-prac.js"></script>
<!--no harm in creating a js file, but not necessary, can also link to it in the head however disadvantage is there may be tons of megabytes to load this way, forces user to load all the js before page view, 10 second rule! -->
<!--best practice to put script at end of html for resources-->
