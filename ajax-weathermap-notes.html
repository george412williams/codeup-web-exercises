    <h4>Weather Map API</h4>
    <p>using simpler code names that do stuff under the hood
    using api's like the map use
    <p>web api's
        commonly restful api's can get info for url request
        info back in a data transmission language
        previously using JSON, allowing us to communicate back and forth
        now can leverage thousands of api's to flech out extra fx
        mapbox is a web api
        so can pull in data from other sources as well
            ex pokemon, star wars' api, weather global api
        restful api's - a service request to and pull data
    </p>
    <p>
WEATHER MAP

    Will bring in mapbox plus forecast info (curric ex)
    will take much experimenting

    Weather API

        openweather provides several different api's
        [going over the site, pricing free, api's
    </p>
    <p>
    Curric note:

        has evolved to adapt to api's, darksky api was bought out and
        phasing out, so had to go back to openweather

        using One Call API

        take curric w grain of salt, ex's a good, but our endpoint
        will be diff such as 'weather' vs the One Call API
