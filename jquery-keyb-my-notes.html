    // the referred to area will be added to
    // he held key down and kept repeating mult times

    // will respond to arrows, backspace, etc

    // should perform just once upon the release,

    $('#ted').on("keydown",function () {

    // used span to create a highlight click
    // more fxality for .on later
    // with click: .on("click", function() {...
    // he did a series of ons offs in a hover
        // turn off mouse enter from earlier and txts 'back from the dead'
    // to content.append spanh1 was clickedspan

    // $('h1').hover(function () {
    //     $('#content').append("<span>Key was pressed</span>");
    // });
    // added a back and forth with a click end then...

    // turned off in the click event at the end which turned off all fxality
        // so can turn off anything at once by not giving it an arguement, or
        // specifiy ones to off sep'd by a comma and in quotes
        // remember if you have a hover you may have to address the in and out of it
        // though he could not address it properly to turn off

    //when click on a span, doesn't change background of the container, only for the span that is clicked
    // which was created from a keypress event which can then be highlight from this event

    // so now we play in the space

    // EX, uncomment to see it not change the bgd color

    $('.banana').click(function () {
        $(this).css('background','grey');
    });
    // bc he added the event to the DOC, not necessarily to the entire doc, but
        // to ea indiv node on page load, means on page load do i ever
        // have the class of banana on the page, but when fired off, then creates
        // the banana span, so bc of that added dynamically, the event has not been added
        // with the .click method
        // earlier, with .on method, it did beh as expected
        // so happens with the more durable/actionable .on method, doc knows to look
        // for that class being clicked
        // idea is if ever have event created on dynamically created event, use .on and not
            // not .click(for stuff statically made on the doc/
            // .on for things newly create the new fxality

    // EXERCISE

        // KONAMI CODE: contra code!! updownupdownababselectstart...
        // in web dev, nerds and fun, website easter eggs
        // KONAMI code on websites

            // type in sequence on David's web site
            // input updownupdown etc.
            // also made the other cheat code inputs, donkey kong country

                // went to keycode.info to find the keycode string for the keys

        // exercise gives starter code, can change property to be the code or key
            // so take note of what value to check forhte key
            // can be one big long concat str and see if it is rep'd from users typing on page
            // David did different arrays and it sequence matched arrays,
                // and has diff var to represent different position in the code
                // a var that looks at konami vs sega code...
                // had list of vars with arrays to be matched up
